# Web-Remote-Control-Unity-Example

This was just a quick Unity app to test the idea of using the browser on mobile phones as remote controls for Unity games using websockets.
I have a short demostration here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAmI4EY-N0o

The website code can be found over at Glitch: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/fog-larch?path=server.js you can easily remix the code from there if you want to play with it
